### Title: 
Application of Huffman coding on image file by Obaid Ur Rehman Ansari
### Description:
Huffman codes are lossless data compression codes. Huffman codes are used for data communications, audio coding, and for image and video compression.
This code is written in python and gives the output of huffman coding in a text file named 'huffman_codes' while also printing the efficiency of compression. This text file contains the Huffman codes for each pixel value in the image.
#### Technologies used:
Python 3
#### Run the program:
Run the file huffmanimage.py in a compiler or type the command python huffmanimage.py in the terminal.
